FAQ

> This is really annoying, why can't I just install it as an extension using the extension store?

Great question - this extension is currently under review, and once it is approved, you will be able to install it from the extension store.

> How do I know this is safe and you aren't mining bitcoin on my computer?

Another great question! This is open source, so you can simply look at the files within this repository before you load them onto your browser. If you are not technically savvy,
I would recommend asking a friend to look at the code, or copying the code into ChatGPT and asking it if it sees anything nefarious.

> It didn't work and I'm angry!

It happens. Page layout changes in YouTube or DreamingSpanish can cause this extension to no longer function properly. If this happens, please feel free
to open an issue on this repository and I will get to it as soon as I can.

> You should add X feature

I'd love to add more features to this. Please feel free to open an issue on this repository and I will be happy to get to it when I have the time.
